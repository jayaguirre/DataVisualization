		Extra Credit Visualization: For this improved visualization of chart 2, I decided to go with
		the use of opacity to improve the clarity. In the chart when there are stacked circles there
		is no way to tell if a circle is beneath another one. I set the opacity of the circle fill
		to 0.4 and the circle stroke color to black (from transparent). With these changes you can
		now tell with more ease whether or not there is a circle underneath any given circle.
